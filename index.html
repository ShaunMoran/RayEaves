            <div>
                <p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their couriosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team.  Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture.  lean and mondern.   Playful and functional.  Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple.  That was and is the "Eames look".</p>

                <p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with oulded playwood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eams lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York</p>
                
                <p>Charles and Ray achieved their monument al succcess by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrique us?  Can we make it better?</p>

                <p class="personal quote">"Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely &amp; to the best of your ability, &amp; that way, you might change the world"<br> <span>- Charles Eames</span></p>

                <p>The loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and prodcut, style and function.  "The details are not details," said Charles.  "They make the product".</p>

                <div class="img-wrap">
                    <img src="img/chair2.png"  alt="front view of chair">
                    <img class="img-right" src="img/chair3.png" alt="under view of chair">
                    <img class="img-right" src="img/chair4.png" alt="under view of chair">
                </div>

                <p>Their own concetpts evolved over time, not overnight.  As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash"</p>

                <p>A design critic once said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place".  That they did.  That also made it a lot more interesting. </p>
